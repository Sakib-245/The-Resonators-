City Emergency Health Hub
A real-time emergency response platform connecting patients, hospitals, and ambulances with live bed tracking, SOS GPS routing, and a community broadcast system.

Strict Role-Based Access
The system uses email-based access control to protect sensitive features:

Public/Patients: Open access to find beds and trigger SOS.(ffor judges)

Hospital Admins: Restricted panel for authorized staff to manage bed inventory and receive SOS alerts.

Ambulance Drivers: Restricted tactical cockpit for designated drivers to accept dispatches and transmit vitals.
(Ambulance and Hospital won't be visible to judges cause of ristrticeted access to them.)

Core Features by Role
Patient Portal: One-click SOS with live GPS tracking, medical profile storage, and a voice-enabled community chat.

Admin Portal: Live inventory (beds/ventilators) updating, flashing SOS alerts that auto-reserve beds, and direct ambulance chat.

Ambulance Cockpit: Incoming dispatch alerts with patient medical history, live Leaflet routing to the pickup point, and animated ECG/vitals syncing.

Tech Stack
Built using HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Firebase (Auth & Real-time Firestore), Leaflet.js (OSRM routing), Chart.js, and the Web Speech API.
